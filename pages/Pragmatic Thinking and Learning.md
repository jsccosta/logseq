- Avoid copy paste coding
- Know what you don’t know.
	- This can be done by taking on challenges that you may not be familiar with
		- practice needs to be challenging but doable
- Intuition and pattern matching replace explicit knowledge
	- practice coding patterns
		- what are coding patterns
- Look into modes of acquiring expertise
# Learn by watching and imitating
	- first you imitate existing practice and then slowly assimilate the tacit knowledge and experience over time. Finally you’ll be
	  in a position to go beyond imitation and innovate.
- A group is only as good as its weakest link. Put the best performers together to perform for the main service, and create
  “farm teams” for other services.
- Keep a steady group with the same performers every week.
  You want the group to jell; rotating players in and out is
  counterproductive.
# Keep practicing in order to remain expert.
# Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or inventiveness.
# Learn the skill of learning.
# Next actions
- LATER Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model
  for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your
  current skill level impacts you.
- TODO Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced begin-
  ner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order
  incompetence when making these evaluations.
- TODO For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to
  the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the
  remainder of this book.
- TODO Think back to problems you’ve experienced on a project team.
  Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been
  aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going
  forward?
- TODO Think of your teammates: Where are they on their journey?
  How can that be helpful to you?
