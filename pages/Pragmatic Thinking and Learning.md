- Avoid copy paste coding
- Know what you don’t know.
	- This can be done by taking on challenges that you may not be familiar with
		- practice needs to be challenging but doable
- Intuition and pattern matching replace explicit knowledge
	- practice coding patterns
		- what are coding patterns
- Look into modes of acquiring expertise
# Learn by watching and imitating
	- first you imitate existing practice and then slowly assimilate the tacit knowledge and experience over time. Finally you’ll be
	  in a position to go beyond imitation and innovate.
- A group is only as good as its weakest link. Put the best performers together to perform for the main service, and create
  “farm teams” for other services.
- Keep a steady group with the same performers every week.
  You want the group to jell; rotating players in and out is
  counterproductive.
# Keep practicing in order to remain expert.
# Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or
inventiveness.
